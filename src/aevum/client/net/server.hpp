 * @class Server
 * @brief Manages the full lifecycle of the AevumDB network server, handling client connections
 * and dispatching requests to the core database engine.
 *
 * @details This class implements a robust, multi-threaded TCP server. Upon calling `run()`, it
 * establishes a listening socket on a specified port. It then enters a loop, accepting new client
 * connections and spawning a dedicated `std::thread` for each one. This architecture allows for
 * concurrent handling of multiple clients.
 *
 * The server ensures graceful shutdown via the `stop()` method, which closes all active sockets and
 * joins all worker threads. Thread-safe management of client connections is handled using a
 * `std::mutex`.
